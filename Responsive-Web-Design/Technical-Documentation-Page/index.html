            <header><h3>About Python</h3></header>
            <p>
                Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum 
                at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands 
                as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL), 
                capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba 
                operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is an interpreted, multi-paradigm programming language that is easy to use 
                due to it's capability to allow programs to be written compactly 
                and readably. Programs written in Python are typically shorter than 
                those written in C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        the high-level data types allow you express complex operations 
                        in a simple statement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and
                        ending breaks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        no variable or argument declarations are necessary.
                    </li>
                </ul> 
            </p>
            <p>
                Python is supported by a wide variety of frameworks and libraries which widens it's use cases 
                significantly.
                It can be used for;
                <ol>
                    <li>Web Development (using frameworks such as Flask and Django</li>
                    <li>Data Science (using Pandas, Numpy etc)</li>
                    <li>Machine Learning (using PyTorch, Scipy, Matplotlib, Tensorflow etc)</li>
                </ol>
                And many more.

                To download python and get started, head on to their <a href="https://www.python.org">website.</a><br>
                When it's installed, launch it in interactive mode and let's move on to Hello World.

            <!-- hello world in python -->
            <header><h3>Hello World in Python</h3></header>
            <p>
                To begin learning how to use python and getting your hands dirty, you can start by 
                logging a basic "Hello World" statement to the terminal.<br>
                Python comes with numerous built-in functions, in this case we can use the print() function.<br>
                You need to declare the function then pass it an argument which would be what you want to print out.<br>
                So, that would be - print(argument)
                We also want what we are printing out to output as exactly what we type in, so we need to wrap it in quotes.<br>
                <code>>>>print("Hello World")<br>Hello World</code><br>
                This should print out "Hello World" (without the quotes)to the terminal.
            </p>
            <p></p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Character_Types">
            <!-- Python character types and basics, arithmetic operators -->
            <header><h3> Character Types</h3></header>
            <p>
                Python supports various character types.
                <h4>Numbers</h4>
                Any whole number falls into this category.<br>
                This python interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value.<br>
                It uses operators such as; + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division, and ** for square.<br>
                <code>
                    >>> 2 + 2<br>
                    4<br>
                </code>
                <code>
                    >>> 50 - 5 * 6<br>
                    20<br>

                </code>
                <h4>Strings</h4>
                Python can also manipulate strings, which can be experssed in several ways. They can be expressed in single quotes ('...')
                or double quotes ("...").
                \ can be used to escape quotes.<br>
                <code>
                    >>> 'Gummy Worms' # single quotes<br>
                    Gummy Worms<br>
                    >>> 'doesn\'t' # \ to escape quotes<br>
                    doesn't<br>
                    >>> "She said 'Yes'" # double quotes<br>
                    She said 'Yes'<br>
                </code>
                # is used to "comment out" code which basically tells the interpreter to ignore the following statements which comes after the #, 
                which is great for documenting your code as shown in the snippet.
                
                <h4>Booleans</h4>
                Python also supports booleans which are statements that evaluate to either true or false.<br>
                We will use the built-in function type() to check the type of character.<br>
                <code>
                    >>>type(True)<br>
                    class 'bool'<br>
                </code>
                <h4> Floats</h4>
                Python also recogonises floating point numbers (decimal numbers).<br>
                <code>
                    >>>type(12.0)<br>
                    class 'float'<br>
                </code>
                
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <!-- Python Data Structures -->
            <header><h3>Variables</h3></header>
            <p>
                We use variables to associate character types to symbolic names.<br>
                To do that, we need to declare the variable as such;<br>
                
                <code>
                    >>>my_lucky_number = 56<br>
                </code>
                Then we can go ahead and print out our variable which should output the value we assigned to it.<br>
                <code>
                    >>>my_lucky_number<br>
                    56<br>

                </code>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
            <!-- Control flow statements -->
            <header><h3>Data Types</h3></header>
            <p>
                Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. 
                The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated 
                values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, 
                but usually the items all have the same type.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>
                    >>>list_of_squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]<br>
                    >>>list_of_squares<br>
                    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]<br>
                </code>
                Python also supports other data types such as sets and dictionaries.

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Control_Flow_Statements">
            <!-- Control flow statements in Python -->
            <header><h3>Control Flow statements</h3></header>
            Control flow statements use indentation. Indentation is python's way of grouping statements together.<br>
            <p>
                <h4>if...else statements</h4>
                Python uses the popular if statements just like any other programming language.<br>
                <code>
                    my_lucky_number = 56<br>
                    if my_lucky_number < 100:<br>
                    ....print("Yes")<br>
                    elif my_lucky_number > 100:<br>
                    ....print("Wow")<br>
                </code>
                elif here represents else if, which is useful to avoid excessive indentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>For statements</h4>
                Python's for statements are used to iterate over items of any sequence(a list or string), in the
                order that they appear in the sequence.<br>
                <code>
                    words = ['car', 'window', 'python']<br>
                    for word in words:<br>
                    ....print(word, len(word))<br>
                    cat 3<br>
                    window 6<br>
                    python 6<br>
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>While loops</h4>
                A while loop always executes as long as a condition remains true.<br>
                In the example below, the code will always execute as long as a is less than 5.<br>
                <code>
                    a = 1<br>
                    while a < 5:<br>
                    ....print(a)<br>
                    ....a += 1<br>
                    1<br>
                    2<br>
                    3<br>
                    4<br>

                </code>
